moved game function to it's own file: game.py

AI seems to be kind of working but computer never seems to lose against scissors. Just tie or lose.

-variables were set so you could never lose if you picked paper *fixed placement of rock paper scissors in game.py

if you choose anything but one of the choices, the game automatically grants user a win.
Not sure to how to fix this.

def validOption():
    if gameVars.player not in (gameVars.choices):
        gameVars.player = input("Please Choose a Valid Option")
        return gamePlay()

was my attempt.

added a better feature to win every game without fail
